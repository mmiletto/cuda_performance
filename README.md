# CUDA performance
This repository contains experiments using CUDA to test and understand performance in different scenarios and with different algorithms.
The different directories will hold the experiments.

For data post-processing and presenting I will use emacs + Org mode and R for data presentation.

The idea here is also to explore different performance analysis tools like the NVIDIA provided tools and other tracing tools (https://developer.nvidia.com/performance-analysis-tools):
- NVIDIA Nsight Systems
- NVIDIA Visual Profiler
- TAU Performance System
- The PAPI CUDA Component
- The NVIDIA CUDA Profiling Tools Interface
